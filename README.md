# Flipper ARTM NFC card scans
_I decided I should start sharing the NFC scans of all the discarded cards I've been finding in the Metro in Montreal. Lots of fun decoding them. I'll keep adding more over time.  Enjoy! -Pathfinder_

Various NFC-based [ARTM](https://www.artm.quebec/) transit cards in Quebec scanned with the [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/).
 
All these scans are from discarded cards that people have thrown away. Learn more about [the different types of cards used in the ARTM system](https://www.artm.quebec/en/fares/fare-platform/) including the [Exo Solo card system](
https://exo.quebec/en/fares/opus-card/solo-card).

Use the ARTM's Chrono app ([Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=quebec.artm.chrono) or [Apple Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chrono-bus-metro-and-train/id1261397728)) to scan and view transit card data (card type, remaining rides, visited lines, zones, etc.).

I can be reached on Twitter and in both the [Official Flipper Devices](http://flipperzero.one/discord) and [Rogue Master Firmware](https://discord.gg/gF2bBUzAFe) Discords.
