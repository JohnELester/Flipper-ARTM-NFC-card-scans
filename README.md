# Flipper ARTM NFC card scans (and other Train Cards)
_I decided I should start sharing the NFC scans of all the discarded cards I've been finding in the Metro in Montreal. Lots of fun decoding them. I'll keep adding more over time.  Enjoy!_

Various NFC-based [ARTM](https://www.artm.quebec/) transit cards in Quebec scanned with the [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/).
 
All these scans are from discarded cards that people have thrown away. Learn more about [the different types of cards used in the ARTM system](https://www.artm.quebec/en/fares/fare-platform/) including the [Exo Solo card system](
https://exo.quebec/en/fares/opus-card/solo-card).

Use the ARTM's Chrono app ([Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=quebec.artm.chrono) or [Apple Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chrono-bus-metro-and-train/id1261397728)) to scan and view transit card data (card type, remaining rides, visited lines, zones, etc.).

I can be reached on Twitter and in both the [Official Flipper Devices](http://flipperzero.one/discord) and [Rogue Master Firmware](https://discord.gg/gF2bBUzAFe) Discords.

_IMPORTANT NOTE: I'm sharing data on *dead* cards that were found as discarded trash.  If you want scans of *valid* cards, you'll have to do that yourself.  I'm not encouraging or enabling anyone to ride for free.  With my provided scans you can use the data to learn how different data are encoded on the card (e.g., visited transit lines, dates, timestamps, card type, etc.)  It's a fun academic puzzle to decipher._
